# Hill of Towie Wind Turbine Power Prediction

**Repository for a solution to the Kaggle competition: [Hill of Towie Wind Turbine Power Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hill-of-towie-wind-turbine-power-prediction/overview)**

## Competition Overview

The goal of this Kaggle challenge is to **predict the Active Power output of a target wind turbine at the Hill of Towie wind farm**, using historical data from nearby turbines. Accurate power prediction is crucial for optimizing wind farm operations and integrating renewable energy into the grid[^1][^2].

## Dataset

- The dataset is derived from the **Hill of Towie wind farm open dataset**, containing several years of operational data from multiple turbines[^3][^4].
- Features include turbine-level measurements (e.g., wind speed, direction, temperature) and timestamps.
- The target variable is the **Active Power** of a specific turbine[^2][^3].


## Solution Approach

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.
- **Modeling:** Machine learning regression models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks) to predict turbine power output.
- **Evaluation:** Model performance is assessed using metrics such as RMSE, as per competition guidelines[^1][^2].


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NaySten-Labs/kaggle-power-prediction
cd hill-of-towie-power-prediction
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
uv sync
```

3. **Download the competition data** from Kaggle and place it in the `data/` directory.
4. **Run the training script:**

```bash
python train.py
```

5. **Generate predictions for submission:**

```bash
python predict.py
```
